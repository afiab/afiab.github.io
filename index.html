    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Afia 
        (which was probably obvious with the title above). 
        I graduated from Stuyvesant High School in June 2023,
        which was where I really started exploring software engineering.
        In my free time, I like to 
        read books, play games like Tetris or Project Sekai,
        and work on random code projects. 
        My favorite color is Purple,
        and my favorite food is onigiri, pictured below 
        (I really like the salmon and tuna ones).
    </p>

    <h2>RIT Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>Here is a link to the 
        <a href="https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-software-engineering#scholarships">RIT Software Engineering</a>
        website.
    </p>

    <h2>What I'd like to learn</h2>
    <p>From this course I'd like to learn the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to navigate through the 
            Software Engineering curriculum at RIT
        </li>
        <li>What are some online tools I can use to 
            facilitate team software development
        </li>
        <li>
            How to make an effective portfolio site and 
            personal projects
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's a numbered list since there was no specification of 
        the desired list type:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I want to hear from more people who can provide
            applicable advice for software engineering
        </li>
        <li>also tips on finding summer opportunities
            because I literally can't find anything
        </li>
    </ol>
